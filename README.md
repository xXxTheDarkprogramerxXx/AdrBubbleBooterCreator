## Usage:
- Install Adrenaline v6.X and 661.PBP file if it is not already installed,
 then run it from the bubble and make sure it's working fine before doing anything.

### *** THIS IS JUST ONE TIME UNLESS THERE IS A NEW UPDATED VERSION ***
- Copy 'AdrBubbleBooterInstaller.vpk' to your PSVita 'ux0:' then install and run it
 to install\update the required files for AdrBubbleBooter, after that remove it if you want.
- Reboot the PSVita for changes to take effect if it is not rebooted by the installer.

### *** THIS IS FOR MAKING BUBBLE FOR EACH FILE ***
- Start AdrBubbleBooterCreator.exe and fill the required fields then press 'Create' button
 to create a VPK file for each file you want to direct boot it, after that copy the generated
 VPK file to your PSVita and install it.

### *** THIS IS FOR CHANGING BOOT CONFIGS FOR THE BOOTED BUBBLE ***
- Start the PSVita and boot the created VPK bubble, open adrenaline menu and go to Booter tab
 then change the settings and exit the menu to save the configs.
